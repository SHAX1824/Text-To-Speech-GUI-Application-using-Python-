# Text-To-Speech-GUI-Application-using-Python-
It is a GUI application of Text to Speech where you can type the text or copy paste the text. The bot willl read the text for you
I have used python inbuilt library tkinter and one more additional library which is pyttsx3 for text to speech conversion . This project has a GUI application where you can copy the text which u want the bot to speak and u can click on speak.

Use of this project =>
1) This project is useful for visually impaired people where they can hear the text
2) It is also useful for mutism people they can convey the message by typing text in this application
3) Sometimes we feel so lazy that we won't be in a mood to study the text we can use this application to just copy paste our files and we can listen to the bot which speaks the text for us.
